# A Brussels' tale

Now [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCqRmx3Dnw) is a story all about how ,

My life got flipped turned upside down ,

And I'd like to take a minute , just sit right there  
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

I'll tell you how I became the prince

of a site called Git Hub

It was a large lovely garden,

with soft green grass.

Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars,

## Ik ging slapen met een doezoe, werd wakker met een ton
## En vaak denk ik aan vroeger, ik weet waar het begon
## Nu denk ik aan miljoenen, nee vraag me niet waarom

<<<<<<< HEAD

I learned everything that cheat sheets and other sites taught me.

I tried over and over but bugs were everywhere.

I worked hours over an exquisite corpse and finally learned it.

Lol

We love [GitHub](https://github.com) so much :heart:

It will be so *fun* when everybody will use it and we should manage `100` conflicts.

Master and branches power

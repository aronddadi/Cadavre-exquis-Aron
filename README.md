# Cadavre-exquis-Aron
# A Brussels' tale

Now [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nCqRmx3Dnw) is a story all about how ,

My life got flipped turned upside down ,

And I'd like to take a minute , just sit right there  


I'll tell you how I became the prince

of a site called Git Hub

It was a large lovely garden,

with soft green grass.

Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars,

## Ik ging slapen met een doezoe, werd wakker met een ton
## En vaak denk ik aan vroeger, ik weet waar het begon
## Nu denk ik aan miljoenen, nee vraag me niet waarom



I learned everything that cheat sheets and other sites taught me.

I tried over and over but bugs were everywhere.

I worked hours over an exquisite corpse and finally learned it.

Lol

##I'm not going to write.
_In your stupid repo._
*Really not,i'm not a sheep*

We love [GitHub](https://github.com) so much :heart:

It will be so *fun* when everybody will use it and we should manage `100` conflicts.

Master and branches power

PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT

 In westmael, born and raised.
 On the Pub was where I spent most of my days.
 Chillin' out drinkin' all cool.


 L'ennui dans ce monde, c'est que les idiots sont sûrs d'eux et les gens sensés pleins de doutes.

Here we go

Once upon a time not long ago

When people wore pajamas and lived life slow

When laws were stern and justice stood

And people were behavin' like they ought ta good

There lived a lil' boy who was misled

# Im just making a mess on everyones repository.
## Because i don't understand the exercise very wel.
### I hope i'm doing it right.



#### Yeah same here ####

Maurice and i are working on this together but ...

We can't seem to completely understand what we're doing...
